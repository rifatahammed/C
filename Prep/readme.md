Given a left aligned string asked to make it center aligned.
///done

I was asked to do some calculation given an array of integers.
///done

Find most frequent and 2nd most frequent small letter from a given string

From a given Postfix notation construct an expression tree

How to left align some strings
=By adding spaces based on their length difference with the longest string

what is the difference between ViewBag, ViewData and TempData.

String manipulation problem and tree based question

Given a list of tree node. Generate the full tree using parent and child ID.
=I have used two queue to solve it. Also told the solution using dictionary and recursion.

Q: Write an algorithm to reverse a string.
=#include
#include

int main()
{
char temp, st[100];
gets(st);
int i, f=0, l = strlen(st);
int n = l/2;
l = l-1;
for(i=0; i

Coding phase question 1: Given a string the interview asked to make each new line of the string center aligned. Each new line was identified by special character '\r\n'

Coding phase question 2: Given a string the interview asked to find the most frequent character and the second most frequent character

Coding phase question 1:The interview gave a list of nodes from a collection of trees where each node has an id and a name (string) and another id which determines its parent(-1 in case the node is a root). The trees (forest) had to be constructed from the given information.

There were 2 steps. First one is written and second one is coding test. Everyone passes the first round easily. It consists of some basic programming and database questions. The second round takes place for one hour and 2 problems are given. One is alignment and another one is about graph theory.

To write an string modifier function in C.

1. String reverse
2. Age-related to math etc.

Write a program the prints the multiple of 3 from 1 to 200 in reverse order.

Q: What if an array is empty but stack implementation wants to pop from it?

The coding test contains problems involving text alignment and binary trees.

Janes age 3 times is equal to Beths age 8 times and the difference of their ages is 15. Find ages.

Some ladder problem, circle problem for analytical questions. Array sum with file, i++, i-- related questions. Showing some interfaces, we had to find the wrong representation and how it should be improved.

Find multiples of 3 between 200-0. And more.

Write a function to reverse a string

After a week I was asked to sit in a technical interview. It was in C# and I was asked to add a new line to an input string when it exceeded a given limit of characters per line.

The string based problem asked for center aligning a multi lined string.

second problem, they asked for adding a node to a multi rooted tree.

For coding test they only allow C#, and have to code on there pc's visual studio.

print 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 by using only one loop

Another is maximum number of small characters in a string

What is the different between depth first search and breadth first search?

Reverse a given string word by word.

In coding test I was given greedy problems, where the hardest one was about basic linked list.

You'll be given some text in a file. The text in the file can be left align, right-align, or center align. You need to align those texts with the interviewer's choice.

First question was about center aligning string from a plain string

Second question was about binary hierarchical tree that can make parent child relationship.

One more tipis:
They take coding interview in C# language with Visual Studio(Not Visual Studio Code). You need to complete a method function in class . You need to pass value to another method to show output .

{{
there is no option for C++. Only C# allowed with Visual Studio. They will give you 3-4 days to learn C# . That is pretty hard to learn C# in 3-4 days and implement DSA in C# .
So if your written exam is great ,you should learn C# from now and solve problem in C#

    Question 1 : They will give you documentation about problem 1 . you will be given plain String . This string is formatted with /r/n. Split the sentence with /n/r and make it center/left/right alignment
    Suppose 1\n123\n1234\n
    output : 1
    123
    1234
    there is /r too ,you need to use that

    problem 2: Binary Hierarchal Tree will be given ! You need to add child with their parent. That is pretty hard question. If you can solve this than Welcome to Enosis

    you welcome

}}

in the written test for the Intern they make 15 mcq question from java,datastructure and javascript

Reverse words of a sentence

The first problem was easy but the second one required data structure and algorithms.

Interview Questions
Oop

What is Vector in C++ STL?

Array based questions. String related problems.There are actually 7-8 programming problms.

# 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 print this in one loop

def function():
for i in range(200,0,-1):
a=i\*3
print(a)
return
function()

stack-queue etc.

Coding: Same right-alighment problem + Tree construction problem.

Write a function to read integers from a file and output their average

# Given the relationships between some entities and a method to create a tree node (requires name of the node and reference to its parent node, i.e. you can't create a child before its parent), you have to make relationship tree of the entities.

I did it with a simple DFS.
.

# 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

=function print () {
for (let i = 10; ; i--) {
if(i <1) {
console.log(2-i);
if(i===-8) break;
}
else
console.log(i);
}
}

print();

{
Q1:
They will provide a code base. A function will be implemented for either right align, left align or center align of a passage. You will need to tweak the given function for expected alignment asked.
}

{
Q2:
id name parent_id
1 abcd -1
2 bcdf 1
3 efgh 2
normalNode{
id;
name;
parentId;
}
treeNode n = add(string name, treeNode parentNode) //normal
treeNode n = add(string name) //parent
make a tree out of these given list structure.
}

Basic programming, analytical, testing and debugging questions

1. Find the duplicates elements among arrays.
2. Sum two numbers from the file inputs etc
   }

What is OOP? what is vector?

You are asked to write the code for right-aligning a text in a text-box.

1. Take input from file.

{Programming Question :

1. Reverse string ( input=abc, output=cba)
2. Reverse word
3. Check duplicate elements... etc

Testing Question:

1. They will give a picture of a software and tell you to find the testing features
2. Finding errors from code}

{
The written exam was of 1 hour and included the following questions:

(1) Write a function that will receive a string as an input and will return the string in reverse order.

(2) Write a function that will print the following series of numbers using only one loop:

"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1"

(3) Write a function that will print all the multiples of 3 between 1-200 ( in reverse order )

There were other programming questions as well but of the same difficulty level. Along with the coding questions there were some analytical and QA questions as well. And for me the best part of this exam was there's no language specification. You can answer all the coding questions in whichever programming language you are comfortable with.

So, after giving the exam I was impressed to know that they basically want to see how much problem solving skills do you have rather than evaluating you by the number of languages and frameworks you know.
